# What is Politor ?
Politor is a Modular collection of gulp-tasks

# Getting started

install the politor-cli (`npm i -g politor-cli`)

- scaffold your project by running `politor create AppName`
- choose a core-module to start with i.e. `Angular 1` (this will create a basic app structure with a template gulpfile and package.json)

run the preregistered tasks politor provides for your development workflow
